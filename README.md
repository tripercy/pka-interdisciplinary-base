This is a [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) project bootstrapped with [`create-llama`](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/packages/create-llama).

This project is the baseline test for out interdisciplinary project. This uses google's gemini embedding model and LlamaIndexParse to digest documents,
store the embeddings in the file system environment (since the scale is small) and serve the API called through Python FastAPI.

The frontend was created using NextJS, it is a simple webpage to prototype the functionalities of this approach.
